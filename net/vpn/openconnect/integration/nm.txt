1. some versions of networkmanager plugin (at least in plasma) have a bug with openconnect
    when you create openconnect vpn connection with GP protocol specified it's not really saved in config and stays as "Pulse"
    AFAIR after you save and reopen connection properties.

    to change it you need to stop networkmanger service and change line to "protocol=gp" in corresponding file in
        /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
    the start NM service back. at

    but it was unresolved for a long time and in many versions and still could be encountered somewhere

2. connecting to global vpn.<org>.com portal or any local portal like vpn-eu.<org>.com causes unnecessary checks on vpn server side
   I believe as GP vpn portal may have several gateways configured actually (not very <org> case but still).
   to connect to the exact gate avoiding those checks or resolve any other possible issue you can specify it as /gateway
    like vpn-eu.<org>.com/gateway
   in connection config.
