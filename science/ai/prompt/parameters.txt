Employing advanced prompt parameters enables prompt engineers to achieve, among others, several objectives:
  Control response length and stop sequence
  Define the underlying model
  Manage the Creativity Level
  Control frequency and presence penalties
  Inject start and restart text

The "temperature [0 to 1]" is a parameter that controls the creativity and randomness of the model's output. 
A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the output more focused and deterministic.


The "top_p [0-1]" (also known as nucleus sampling) dictates the scope of randomness for the language model. 
It determines how many random results the model should consider based on the temperature setting.

The "stop_sequences [list of strings]" is a list of strings or tokens that, when encountered by the model, will cause it to stop generating further text. 
This helps control the length and structure of the generated content, preventing the model from producing unwanted text beyond the specified stopping point.

The "frequency_penalty [-2 to 2]" parameter reduces the likelihood of the model repeating the same line verbatim by assigning a penalty to more frequent tokens. 
A positive frequency penalty (e.g., 1.0) discourages the model from repeating tokens that appear frequently in the input, while a negative frequency penalty (e.g., -1.0) 
encourages the model to repeat such tokens.

The "presence_penalty [-2 to 2]" parameter increases the chances of the model discussing new topics by penalizing tokens already present in the input. 
A positive presence penalty (e.g., 1.0) discourages the model from using tokens already appearing in the input. 
In contrast, a negative presence penalty (e.g., -1.0) encourages the model to reuse tokens from the input.

The "best_of [positive integer]" allows you to specify the number of completions (n) that the model should generate, 
and it returns the best completion according to the model's internal evaluation. 
This is useful when obtaining the highest quality completion from different possible results. 
(n) can be an integer in the range from 1 to 20.
