A Homotopy is a path between a path - that is, an equality of two equivalences
- Think of a piece of string attached at two end points
A path between a path is still a path
- Homotopies can have homotopies!
- Homotopies over homotopies over homotopies over homotopies over ...
This infinite tower of homotopies endows types with what is called an omega-groupoid structure,
  trivially generated with refl
But remember, refl isn't the only constructor for the identity type!

New intuition:
    types are spaces,
    elemenents are points,
    equalities are paths

Eq-props: refl, trans, symm
    - Types equipped with relations that satisfy these properties are called groupoids
    - You can transform any path to itself - p : a =_A a |- refl: p =_(a=a) p
    - You can concatenate paths
    - You can reverse paths
We have a groupoid over a groupoid!

Equivalences and the univalence axiom
- An equivalence is a pair of transformations between two types
-- Every element of A can be mapped to an element of B, and visa versa
-- Functions on A can be transformed to functions on B by composing with equivalence maps
- Equality is an equivalence ...
-- Trivial - each transformation map is the identity function
- But wouldn't it be great if we could say every equivalence is an equality?
- The univalence axiom: Equivalence is equivalent to equality!
Pi A.B. Type. (A ~= B) ~= (A = B)

Uphold univalent thought! Let 100 univalent universes bloom...
