  (ab)^-1 = b^-1*a^-1

  ab(b^-1a^-1) = a(bb^-1)a^-1 = aa^-1 = 1



Page 85.
  Group element b^-1ab is called a "transformation of a using b".

  When does the following holds???
    a = b^-1ab
    
  Iff (if and only if) the elements commute:
    ab = ba

  Multiplying left by b^-1 having:
    b^-1ab = a


Lema 1 (Conjugation elements symmetry)
  If elt-b is a transformation of elt-a using elt-c
    b = c^-1ac
  Then elt-a is a transformation of elt-b uscing elt-(c^-1):
    cbc^-1 = a
    a = (c^-1)^-1bc

Def (Conjugate elements)
  If one group element is a transformation of the other - they are called conjugant.


Lema 2 (Conjugate elements transitivity).
  If elt-a is adjoint with elt-b, which is adjoint with elt-d,
  then elt-a is ajdoint with elt-d.

  b = c^-1ac
  b = e^-1de

  So,

  c^-1ac = e^-1de

  a = (ce^-1)d(ec^-1) = { p. 33.} = (ec^-1)^-1d(ec^-1)

  In other words, a is a transformation of d usint elt-(ec^-1).

Lema 3 (Adjoint elements reflexivity)
  Every elt-a is adjoint to itself:

  a = 1^-1a1

Theorem 1 (Conjugacy classes)
  Conjugant relation splits group G to the set of equivalence-classes.
  Note: Class of neutral el-t 1 consists only of 1-itself:
    a^-1*1*a = 1  for all a


Def (subgroup transformation)
  Conside H - subgroup of G.
  Let's fix some el-t b of G.

  We call group transformation b^-1Hb a set of

  b^-1Hb = { b^1xb | x of H }

  We can prove (p. 91) that b^-1Hb is indeed a group.


It is obvious that H is isomorphic to b^-1Hb.

Theorem 2.
  Transformation of subgroup H (of group G) using el-t b of G
  is a subgroup of G, isomorphic to H.

Note 1: If H is a subgroup of commutative/abelian group G.
  then subgroup transformation of H using any b of G is H itself

  b^-1xb = {commutativity} b^-1bx = x

Note 2: For every group G and subgroup H, if b belongs to H, then

  b^-1Hb = H

  since b^-1xb belongs to H

Note 3: If subgroup H_2 is a transformation of H_1 using b,
  then H_1 is a transformation of H_2 using b^-1

Def (Conjugative subgroups)
  Two subgroups of group G are called conjugative if one of them is a transformation of another.


Conjugation relation splits subgroups to the equivalence-classes.


Invariant/Normal subgroup

Def 1. If subgroup H of G has no conjugative subgroup (except itself), then it is called
  normal or invariant subgroup.

  In other words - transformation of any element of H, using any element of G, belongs to H.


Example: any subgroup of commutative-abelian group is normal/invariant.


Homomorphisms and Kernel

Page 97...

Page 99.

Kernel of homeomorhic group morphism:
  f : A -> B
  f(ab) = f(a) f(b)

if the set
  a of A, such that
  f(a) = 1_B

In other words, Kernel(f) = f^-1(1_B).

Page 111 - Factor groups...

Page 113.

If U is some normal/invarian gubgroup of G, the set of equivalence-classes V
is a group itself (U is a neutral element).
Group V is called a factor-group of G.
