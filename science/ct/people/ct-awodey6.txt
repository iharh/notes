Exponentials:

Def (6.1) Let the category CatC have binary products. An exponential of objects B and C of CatC consists of an object

  C^B
  
and an arrow

  \eval : C^B x B -> C

such that, for any object Z and an arrow

  f : Z x B -> C

there's a unique arrow

  f~ : Z -> C^B

such that

  \eval . (f~ x 1_B) = f


all as in the diagram:

  C^B          C^B x B -- (\eval) --> C
   .               .               /  
  (f~)         (f~ x 1_B)      (f)
   .               .        /
   Z             Z x B

here is some terminology:

  \eval : C^B x B -> C  is called evaluation

  f~ : Z -> C^B         is called the (exponential) transpose of f.

CCC:

Def (6.2) A category is called cartesian closed if it has all the finite products and exponentials.

Ex (6.4) for the CatPos we have arrows f : P -> Q to be a monotone functions.

  Q^P = { f : P -> Q | f - monotone }

Ex (6.5) for the CatOmegaCPO

  Q^P = { f : P -> Q | f - monotone and omega-continuous }

Prop (6.6) In any CCC, exponentiation by a fixed object A is a functor

  ^(_A) : CatC -> CatC


Note: Check the "Pierce - Basic CT for CS", page 33(42)
***
Exponentiation gives a categorical interpretation to the notion of currying.

  B^A = { f : A -> B | f is a morphism of CatC }

  CatC(A, B) is (can be) representable as an object B^A of CatC.

As usual, we want to characterize B^A by arrows instead of elements.

We observe that with each B^A there is associated function

  \eval : (B^A x A) -> B, defined by

  eval (f, a) = f(a),     on f : A -> B
