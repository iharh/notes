Prop (3.1) (Formal Duality) For any statement \Sigma in the language of CT,
  if \Sigma follows from the axioms for categories, then does so \Sigma^*

  if C |- \Sigma,  then  C |- \Sigma^*

Prop (3.2) (Conceptual Duality) For any statement \Sigma about categories,
  if \Sigma holds foa all categories, the so does the dual statement \Sigma^*


Def (3.3) (Coproducts)
  A diagram

  A -- (q1) --> Q <-- (q2) -- B

  is a "dual-product" (actuall called a coproduct) of A and B if for any Z and

  A -- (z1) --> Z <-- (z2) -- B

  there is a unique u : Q -> Z with z_i = u . q_i

  A -- (z1) --> Z <-- (z2) -- B
                .
               (u)
                .
  A -- (q1) --> Q <-- (q2) -- B

  We usually write A -- (i1) --> A + B <-- (i2) -- B
  for the coproduct and 
  u = [f,g] for the uniquely determined arrow u : A + B -> Z

  The coprojections i1 : A -> A + B  and  i2 : B -> A + B
  are usually called injections,
  even though they not be "injective" in any sense.


  A coproduct of two objects is therefore exactly their product in the opposite category.





Def (3.13) (Equalizers)
  In any category C, given parallel arrows f, g : A -> B
  an equalizer of f and g consists of E and e : E -> A, universal such that:
    f . e = g . e

  That is, given any Z and z : Z -> A with f . z = g . z,
  there is a unique u : Z -> E with e . u = z :

  Z .. (u) ..> E -- (e) --> A -- (f) --> B
  Z --------- (z) --------> A -- (g) --> B


Prop (3.15) In any category, if e : E -> A is an equalizer of some pair of arrows, then it is monic
  See p77 for proof.



Consider equivalence relation (~) at some set X (i.e. - reflexive, symmetrical, transitive).
It define equivalence classes:
  [x] = { y of X | x ~ y }

They form a partition of X.

The set of all equivalence classes,
  X/~ = { [x] | x of X }

may be called a quotient of X by ~

Def (3.17) (Coequalizers)
  For any parrallel arrows f, g : A -> B in a category C,
  a coequalizer of f and g consists of Q and q : B -> Q, universal with the property:
    q . f = q . g

  That is, given any Z and z : B -> Z,
  if z . f = z . g, then
  there exists a unique u : Q -> Z  such that u . q = z :

  A -- (f) --> B -- (q) --> Q .. (u) ..> Z
  A -- (g) --> B --------- (z) --------> Z


First, observe that by duality, such a coequalizer q in a category C is an equalizer
in C^op, hence monic by the last proposition, and so q is epic in C.

Prop (3.18) If q : B -> Q is a coequalizer of some pair of arrows, then q is epic.
