Def (7.1) A functor F : CatC -> CatD is said to be:
  - injective on objects if F_0 : C_0 -> D_0 is injective, the same for surjective

  - .. on arrows ..

  - faithful, if for all A, B of C_0, the map

    F_A,B : Hom_CatC(A, B) -> Hom_CatD(FA, FB)

    defined by f |-> F(f) is injective

  - full, if F_A,B is always surjective


Def (7.6) For categories CatC, CatD and functors

  F, G : CatC -> CatD

  a natural transformation (\nu : F -> G) is a family of arrows in CatD

  (\nu_C : FC -> GC)_(C of CatC_0)

  such that, for any f : C -> C' in CatC, one has

  \nu_C' . F(f) = G(f) . \nu_C

  i.e. the following diagram commutes:

  FC -- (\nu_C) --> GC
   |                |
 Ff.                .Gf
   |                |
  FC'-- (\nu_C')--> GC'

  Given such a natural transformation \nu : F -> G, the \bold D-arrow

  \nu_C : FC -> GC

  is called the "component of \nu at C".


Note: If you think of a functor F : CatC -> CatD as "picture" of CatC in CatD,
  then you can think of a natural transformation \nu_C : FC -> GC
  as a "cylinder" with such a picture at each end


Def (7.9) The functor-category Fun(CatC, CatD) has:

  objects: functors   F  : CatC -> CatD

  arrows : nat-trans \nu : F -> G


Prop (7.13) CatCat (category of categories) is cartesian closed, with the exponentials:

  CatD^CatC = Fun(CatC, CatD)


Prop (7.20) The inclusion functor

  CatPos -> CatCat

  preserves CCC structure.
