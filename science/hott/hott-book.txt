HoTT book:
In homotopy theory one is concerned with spaces and continuous mappings between them, up to homotopy.

A homotopy between a pair of continuous maps
    f : X -> Y and g : X -> Y
is a continuous map
    H : X x [0, 1] -> Y
satisfying
    H(x, 0) = f(x) and
    H(x, 1) = g(x).
    
The homotopy H may be thought of as a "continuous deformation" of f into g.
The spaces X and Y are said to be homotopy equivalent, X ~= Y,
if there are continuous maps going back and forth,
the composites of which are homotopical to the respective identity mappings,

i.e., if they are isomorphic "up to homotopy".

Homotopy equivalent spaces have the same algebraic invariants
(e.g., homology, or the fundamental group),
and are said to have the same homotopy type.

Homotopy type theory (HoTT) interprets type theory from a homotopical perspective.
In homotopy type theory, we regard the types as "spaces" (as studied in homotopy theory)
or higher groupoids, and the logical constructions (such as the product A x B)
as homotopy-invariant constructions on these spaces.

In this way, we are able to manipulate spaces directly without first having to develop point-set topology
(or any combinatorial replacement for it, such as the theory of simplicial sets).
