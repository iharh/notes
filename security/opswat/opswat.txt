At this point there is an workaround -
create Linux virtual machine with no access to the host and all VM extensions disabled
and use it to install this client and access COMPANY resources. 

opswat-client -r or opswat-client -i (-r and -i only, not --rem and --info)
    You can also check the /var/log/opswatclient/ folder
