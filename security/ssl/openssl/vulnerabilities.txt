Today, a new vulnerability in the OpenSSH has been detected.
It affects all versions of the program, from 5.4 to 7.1.
The detected bug allows an attack leading to a leakage of the private key. 

This issue affects the OpenSSH client (not server) on most modern operating systems including Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
This issue may also affect users running OpenSSH for Windows but does not affect users with PuTTY on Windows.

For Unix users and Unix admins:
Servers could be also potentially affected in case key-based auth is used to connect to other servers by ssh.
