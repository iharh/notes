SIGNING OUR OWN CERTIFICATE


?? If you have TLS server installed ???

Generate a self-signed certificate...

If you already have a CSR, create a certificate with:

$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in fd.csr -signkey fd.key -out fd.crt

Signature ok
subject=/CN=www.feistyduck.com/emailAddress=webmaster@feistyduck.com/O=Feisty Duck …
Ltd/L=London/C=GB
Getting Private key
Enter pass phrase for fd.key: ****************

You don’t actually have to create a CSR in a separate step. The following command creates a
self-signed certificate starting with a key alone:

$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key fd.key -out fd.crt

If you don’t wish to be asked any questions, use the -subj switch to provide the certificate
subject information on the command line:

$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key fd.key -out fd.crt -subj "/C=GB/L=London/O=Feisty Duck Ltd/CN=www.feistyduck.com"
