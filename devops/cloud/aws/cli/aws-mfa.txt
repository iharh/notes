    The concept behind aws-mfa is that there are 2 types of credentials:
        long-term - Your typcial AWS access keys, consisting of an
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        short-term - A temporary set of credentials that are generated by AWS STS using your long-term credentials
            in combination with your MFA device serial number
            (either a hardware device serial number or virtual device ARN) and one time token code.
            Your short term credentials are the credentials that are actively utilized by the AWS SDK in use.
