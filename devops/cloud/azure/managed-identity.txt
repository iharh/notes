            auto-lifecycle-management,
                once created, can use it (identity) to grant access to, example, DB
            identity is a special type of service-principal (you don't want to worry about it)

            cannot be shared with multiple resources

            created independently on resource, switch tab -> user assigned

            manual-lifecycle-management
            can be shared with multiple resources
