A logical group of containers that we can replicate, schedule, and balance service endpoints across

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: hello
spec:
    containers:
    - name: hello
      image: busybox
      imagePullPolicy: Never # don't check updates from DockerHub
      command:
      - sleep
      - "60"

!!! port is just a way to tell k8s that we declare appropriate port-num
