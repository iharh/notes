    k3sup was developed to automate what can be a very manual and confusing process for many developers,
    who are already short on time.
    Once you've provisioned a VM with your favourite tooling, k3sup means you are only 60 seconds away
    from running kubectl get pods on your own computer.
    If you are a local computer, you can bypass SSH with k3sup install --local
