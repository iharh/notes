auto-deploying manifests
Any file found in
    /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests
will automatically be deployed to Kubernetes in a manner similar to kubectl apply.

It is also possible to deploy Helm charts.
k3s supports a CRD controller for installing charts.
A YAML file specification can look as following (example taken from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/traefik.yaml):

apiVersion: k3s.cattle.io/v1
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: traefik
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  chart: stable/traefik
  set:
    rbac.enabled: "true"
    ssl.enabled: "true"
