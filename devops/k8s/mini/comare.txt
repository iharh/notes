    ! k3s and k0s are mostly identical now
    !  I'm using k3sup to deploy k3s with just a single line per node
    ! (Also: I tested the speed of k3s vs minikube -- k3s was about 3x faster at starting up. Never used k0s.)
    ! Then you'll be happy about k3s 1.21, which has bumped Traefik up to v2.
    ! MicroK8s isn't something that's meant to be used in a production stack (or at least wasn't last I looked). I would avoid that.

    ! k3s is prod-ready in edge,iot,...
    ! k0s also uses upstream k8s version
    ! k0s distribution by default relies on Kine as data store with etcd - the distributed key-value database,
    whereas k3s has replaced etcd with SQLite.
    ! !!! at the moment k3s support etcd as external DB
