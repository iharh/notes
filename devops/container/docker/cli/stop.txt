Exit code > 128 means the unhandled signal

When you use docker stop or docker kill to signal a container, that signal is sent only to the container process running as PID 1.
Since /bin/sh doesn't forward signals to any child processes, the SIGTERM we sent never reached our script.
Clearly, if we want our app to be able to receive signals from the host we need to find a way to run it as PID 1

When the exec form of the CMD instruction is used the command will be executed without a shell:
CMD ["executable","param1?,"param2?]
