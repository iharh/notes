       --stop-timeout
         Timeout (in seconds) to stop a container, or -1 to disable timeout.

       The --stop-timeout flag sets the number of seconds to wait for the container
         to stop after sending the pre-defined (see --stop-signal) system call signal.
         If the container does not exit after the timeout elapses, it is forcibly killed
         with a SIGKILL signal.

       If --stop-timeout is set to -1, no timeout is applied, and the daemon will
         wait indefinitely for the container to exit.
