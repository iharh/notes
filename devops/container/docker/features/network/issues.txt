I ran in this problem with OpenVPN working as well and I've found a solution where you should NOT stop/start OpenVPN server.

Idea that You should specify what exactly subnet you want to use. In docker-compose.yml write:

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.57.0/24
