The overlay and overlay2 drivers are supported on xfs backing filesystems,
    but only with d_type=true enabled.
Use xfs_info to verify that the ftype option is set to 1.
To format an xfs filesystem correctly,
    use the flag -n ftype=1.

If you want to use a separate backing filesystem from the one used by /var/lib/,
format the filesystem and mount it into /var/lib/docker.
Make sure add this mount to /etc/fstab to make it permanent

fs
/var/lib/docker/overlay2

    Not using native diff for overlay2, this may cause degraded performance for building images:
    kernel has CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_DIR enabled
