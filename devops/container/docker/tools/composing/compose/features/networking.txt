issue
failed to create network ...: Error response from daemon: could not find an available,

        Idea that You should specify what exactly subnet you want to use.
        In docker-compose.yml write:
            networks:
              default:
                driver: bridge
                ipam:
                  config:
                    - subnet: 172.16.57.0/24
