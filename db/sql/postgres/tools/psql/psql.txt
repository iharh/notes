\r or \reset
    Resets (clears) the query buffer.
\l[+] or \list[+] [ pattern ]
    List the databases in the server and show their names, owners, character set encodings, and access privileges.
    If pattern is specified, only databases whose names match the pattern are listed.
    If + is appended to the command name, database sizes, default tablespaces, and descriptions are also displayed.
    (Size information is only available for databases that the current user can connect to.)
\dg[S+] [ pattern ]
\du[S+] [ pattern ]
    Lists database roles.
    (Since the concepts of “users” and “groups” have been unified into “roles”, this command is now equivalent to \dg.)
    By default, only user-created roles are shown; supply the S modifier to include system roles.
    If pattern is specified, only those roles whose names match the pattern are listed.
    If the form \du+ is used, additional information is shown about each role; currently this adds the comment for each role.
\dn[S+] [ pattern ]
    Lists schemas (namespaces).
    If pattern is specified, only schemas whose names match the pattern are listed.
    By default, only user-created objects are shown;
    supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.
    If + is appended to the command name, each object is listed with its associated permissions and description, if any.
\dE[S+] [ pattern ]
\di[S+] [ pattern ]
\dm[S+] [ pattern ]
\ds[S+] [ pattern ]
\dt[S+] [ pattern ]
\dv[S+] [ pattern ]
    In this group of commands, the letters E, i, m, s, t, and v stand for foreign table, index, materialized view, sequence, table, and view, respectively. You can specify any or
    all of these letters, in any order, to obtain a listing of objects of these types. For example, \dit lists indexes and tables. If + is appended to the command name, each
    object is listed with its physical size on disk and its associated description, if any. If pattern is specified, only objects whose names match the pattern are listed. By
    default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.

    \dt <role>.*

\d[S+] [ pattern ]
    For each relation (table, view, index, sequence, or foreign table) or composite type matching the pattern,
    show all columns, their types, the tablespace (if not the default) and any special attributes such as NOT NULL or defaults.
    Associated indexes, constraints, rules, and triggers are also shown. For foreign tables, the associated foreign server is shown as well.
    ("Matching the pattern" is defined in Patterns below.)
    For some types of relation, \d shows additional information for each column: column values for sequences,
    indexed expression for indexes and foreign data wrapper options for foreign tables.

    The command form \d+ is identical, except that more information is displayed: any comments associated with the columns of the table are shown,
    as is the presence of OIDs in the table, the view definition if the relation is a view, a non-default replica identity setting.

    By default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.

    Note: If \d is used without a pattern argument, it is equivalent to \dtvsE which will show a list of all visible tables, views, sequences and foreign tables.
    This is purely a convenience measure.
