mainly relevant to lock-based DB impls (while PG is an MVCC-one)

read uncommitted
    not supported by PG
read committed (default)
    (the same 2 selects can bring distinct results)
repeatable read
serializable

show default_transaction_isolation;
    default_transaction_isolation
    -----------------------------
    read committed

at distinct level we use distinct snapshoting strategies ...
