db-init (not created from scratch, but are copied from some template)
    public
    template0
        never should be changed
        we can use it as a template in order to change lc_locale, lc_collate
        (which is impossible from template1)
    template1
        general/common changes
        By default -> copy all from template1
            we can create all the common stuff beforehand -> template1
