If you run into following error in event log. 
ORA-12520: TNS:listener could not find available handler for requested type of server
ORA-12519, TNS:no appropriate service handler found
You should:
I suggest that you read Metalink note 424566.995, which was posted by a user with a similar problem.ÿÿHe claims that
investigation showed that disconnections from Oracle were not being passed immediately to the listener.ÿÿThis caused the
listener to (incorrectly) think that Oracle had reached its session limit.ÿÿHe fixed the problem by increasing the value of
the "processes" startup parameter.ÿÿ(He says that increasing the value of the "sessions" parameter also worked.)ÿÿT
hat doesn't prevent the listener from having an incorrect count of sessions, but it does get around the ORA-12519 error

To do this:
1. Using TOAD connect to DB server with DBA user.
2. Run query ALTER SYSTEM SET PROCESSES = 500 SCOPE = SPFILE
3. Check that settings applies.
select * from v$parameter where upper(name) = 'PROCESSES'
4. Restart Oracle instance.
5. Use select * from v$session to view sessions


D:\oracle10\bin\oradim.exe -startup  -sid orcl -usrpwd * -log oradim.log -nocheck 0 
D:\oracle10\bin\oradim.exe -shutdown -sid orcl -usrpwd * -shutmode immediate -log oradim.log
