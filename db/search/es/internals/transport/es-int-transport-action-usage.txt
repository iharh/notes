*** Node group ***

- TransportNodeOperationAction/NodeOperationRequest
    These are used for actions that must be executed by every node (that is, all the node statistic actions)


*** Broadcast group ***

These classes must extend one of the supported kinds of action available:
- TransportBroadcastOperationAction/BroadcastOperationRequest/Response
    These are used for actions that must be spread across all the clusters

    /**
     * Determines the shards this operation will be executed on. The operation is executed once per shard iterator, typically
     * on the first shard in it. If the operation fails, it will be retried on the next shard in the iterator.
     */
    protected abstract GroupShardsIterator shards(ClusterState clusterState, Request request, String[] concreteIndices);

used by:
    - TransportClearIndicesCacheAction
    - Transport[Flush/Optimize/Recovery/Refresh]Action
    - TransportIndices[Stats/Status/Segments]Action
    - TransportValidateQueryAction
    - TransportCountAction
    - TransportExistsAction
    - TransportPercolateAction
    - TransportSuggestAction


*** Replication group ***
!!! Too heavy !!!

- TransportIndicesReplicationOperationAction

used only by:
    - TransportDeleteByQueryAction

- TransportIndexReplicationOperationAction/IndexReplicationOperationRequest
    Internal transport action that executes on multiple shards, doesn't register any transport handler as it is always executed locally.

    It relies on a shard sub-action that gets sent over the transport and executed on each of the shard.
        -> TransportShardReplicationOperationAction

    The index provided with the request is expected to be a concrete index, properly resolved by the callers (parent actions).

    Since the corresponding action is internal that gets always executed locally, this request never gets sent over the transport.
    The specified index is expected to be a concrete index. Relies on input validation done by the caller actions.

    protected abstract GroupShardsIterator shards(Request request) throws ElasticsearchException;

used by:
    - TransportIndexDeleteAction
    - TransportIndexDeleteByQueryAction

- TransportShardReplicationOperationAction
! uses TransportIndexReplicationOperationAction

    These are used for actions that must be executed at index level (that is, delete by query)


*** Single group ***

- TransportSingleCustomOperationAction/SingleCustomOperationRequest
    Transport action used to send a read request to one of the shards that belong to an index.
    Supports retrying another shard in case of failure.

    These are used for actions that must be executed only by a node (that is, percolate or analyze actions)

used by:
    - TransportAnalyzeAction
    - TransportGetFieldMappingsIndexAction

- TransportInstanceSingleOperationAction/InstanceShardOperationRequest

    !! has a retry() support

    /**
     * Should return an iterator with a single shard!
     */
    protected abstract ShardIterator shards(ClusterState clusterState, InternalRequest request) throws ElasticsearchException;

the only usage is:
    - TransportUpdateAction


- TransportShardSingleOperationAction/SingleShardOperationRequest
    A base class for single shard read operations.
    These are used for actions that must be executed only in a shard (that is, the GET action)

used by:
    - TransportExplainAction
    - TransportGetAction
    - TransportShardMultiGetAction
    - TransportShardMultiPercolateAction
    - TransportSingleShardTermVectorAction
    - TransportSingleShardMultiTermsVectorAction


*** Misc group ***

- TransportSearchTypeAction
    Search specific action (with phases etc.).

- HandledTransportAction
    A TransportAction that self registers a handler into the transport service
used by:
    - TransportBulkAction (uses TransportShardBulkAction)
    - TransportMultiGetAction (uses TransportShardMultiGetAction)
    - TransportGetFieldMappingsAction (uses TransportGetFieldMappingsIndexAction)
    - TransportMultiPercolateAction (uses TransportShardMultiPercolateAction)
    - TransportMultiTermVectorAction (uses TransportSingleShardMultiTermVectorAction)
    - Transport[Get/Put/Delete]IndexScriptAction
    - TransportMoreLikeThisAction
    - TransportSearchAction (uses a lot of specific actions)
    - TransportSearchScrollAction (uses a pair of specific actions)
    - TransportClearScrollAction (uses SearchServiceTransportAction)
    - TransportMultiSearchAction (uses TransportSearchAction)

- TransportMasterNodeOperationAction/MasterNodeOperationRequest
    These are used for actions that must host only the master node (such as index and mapping configuration)
