    ! 6. Leftander dislike long-serve to left (by the line)
    !    need to combine with single short serves to right
    ! 7. When lefthander plays from middle-zone, make topsins to the left only
    !     lefthenders wait right-move
    ! 8. In case if you have recieve-problems move from lefthander ->
    !    move to the center of the table for reception
    ! 9. Most lefthanders (except genious TOPs) hold ball badly and try to be "creative"
    !    you just need to be more stable
    ! 10. In 90 percent of cases lefthander starts attacking from your left to the diagonal
