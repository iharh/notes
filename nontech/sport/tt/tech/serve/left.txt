    ! bat - under the ball
    ! 1 error - only forward movement (need to make also left->right movement)
    ! 2 error - not the same angle before and during contact moment
    ! 3 error - trying to contact directly before our selves (need to have more perpendicalar corpus and table)
    ! 4       - elbow should go up during serve (only shoulder and wrist works, no forearm)
