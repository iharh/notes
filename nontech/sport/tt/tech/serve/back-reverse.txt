Emelyanov - Reverse Serve
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPDI4j_PiY
    ! use grip as for internal pendulum, but big thumb - far from the center
    ! in order to avoid contacting of bat-grip with own wrist
    ! it should go above forearm
    ! forearm works less, mostly - wrist
    ! after serve - push by left leg in order to get neutral stand
    ! comments: main thing to avoid - strong squeezing to sponge
