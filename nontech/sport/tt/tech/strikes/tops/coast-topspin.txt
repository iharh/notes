Utochkin - Wrist while RightTopspin !!!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbSOTrvGlEQ
    ! nachinaem potihu, srednim tempom
    ! asian variant - wrist - to the back - more quality and variative top-spin
    ! european - down - more side-spin, more stability to hit a table, but speed is slower
    !    harder to play non-diagonal
    ! more sportsmens - something in the middle
    !!! wrist movement should not be very high
    !!! wrist is not relaxed - just like a spring
