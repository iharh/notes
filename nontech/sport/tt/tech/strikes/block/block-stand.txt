    !!!
    ! 1. Important to be in a low position and stable
    ! 2. Keep the racket up (racket is above your elbow and sometimes a little bit more vertical than usual)
    ! 3. Not to do too much (just use energy of incoming ball) - very subtle and small action
    ! 4. For slow and spinny topspin - put racket high and use really close angle
    ! 5. For powerfull tops-strike - use more open angle
    ! 6. Train transitions
    ! 7. Keep racket in-front

    ! put your arm in a high position
    ! move forward, but less than for the forehand drive
    ! firm your wrist (ukrepi zapyastie)
    ! ??? block at the highest point (comparing to what ???)
    ! left leg is lower than the right one
    ! block then the ball comes in front of you
    ! ! for backhand everything is the same except your legs (they are almost equal)
    ! for the slow/spinny bal - you have to dip on top of the ball
    ! ... pounching block - for spinny, high and not enough quality ball -> counterattack
    !   to do that you need to put your arm back deeper and make a flat hit on the side of the ball
    !   with a strong forward force
    ! !!! important to lear how to speed-up and slow-down the ball
