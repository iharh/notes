    Note: This labs feature is only visible when your homeserver has MSC3030 enabled
    (in Synapse, add experimental_features -> msc3030_enabled to your homeserver.yaml)
    which means GET /_matrix/client/versions responds with
        org.matrix.msc3030 under the unstable_features key.
    Adds a dropdown menu to the date separator headers in the timeline
    which allows you to jump to last week, last month, the beginning of the room, or choose a date from the calendar.
    Also adds the /jumptodate 2022-01-31 slash command.
