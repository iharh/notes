Link scope, fe80::/10 (it's practically implemented as a /64, but the whole /10 is reserved), is isolated to devices on a layer 2 segment. You can use a device's fe80 address to communicate within the segment, but you'll need an address with a different scope to do any communication that requires routing outside of the segment.

When sending something, everything sent to a link-local address (i.e. fe80::/64) is sent from the link-local address, everything else from the global one.
