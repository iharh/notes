Here's what I got back about the 169 IP's:

"I spoke to Steven Stewart about this and he will follow up, though from what I can see there is nothing to be concerned about.
As I was trying to convey below, IP addresses in this range “169.254.x.x” are generally auto-assigned when a NIC is set to use DHCP, but no DHCP service is available on the network it is connected.
In this scenario, the OS auto-assigns itself an address in this range, after testing for possible IP conflicts.

The odd thing in this case is that none of the physically present NICS in these boxes is setup this way, but a “phantom” NIC shows up from IPCONFIG and is indeed configured with an auto-assigned IP address."
