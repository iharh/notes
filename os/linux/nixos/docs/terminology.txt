    The packages in nix are called derivations and are like mini filesystems, 
        i.e. they have a /bin folder a /lib folder a /share folder etc. 
    These all get linked together to form an environment which becomes your path, includes, and things like that. 
    For example, every derivation added to environment.systemPackages has its bin directory added to your system PATH
