    /bin/bash doesn’t exist on a NixOS system, because everything is stored on the Nix store (/nix/store/)
    You can check the actual location of your bash executable with readlink $(which bash).
    Because your current session contains /run/current-system/sw/bin in its $PATH,
    you’ll be able to run currently installed commands, and /run/current-system/sw/bin/bash will be a symlink to the Nix store
    Of course, you shouldn’t put this exact path in your scripts shebangs.
    Instead, the best way to run bash scripts, in any system, is to use
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
    as shebang.
