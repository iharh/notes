If expressions

    These are expressions, not statements.

        nix-repl> a = 3
        nix-repl> b = 4
        nix-repl> if a > b then "yes" else "no"
            "no"

    You can't have only the then branch, you must specify also the else branch, because an expression must have a value in all cases.
