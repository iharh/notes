    If you are still using Yaourt, we strongly encourage you to switch to an alternative
    like Pamac CLI (package: pamac-cli), Trizen (package: trizen), Yay (package: yay) or Pacaur (package: pacaur);
    and uninstall Yaourt from your system.

    In addition to that, we have dropped support for several packages that depended on yaourt:
        allservers, pacli and pacli-jwm.
    Those packages has been removed from the official repositories completely.
