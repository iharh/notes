    /etc/mtab thus has popularly become a symbolic link to /proc/mounts,
    allowing programs that had hardwired that name to keep reading a mount table from that file,
    which the programs that mounted and unmounted filesystems no longer have to explicitly do anything themselves to keep up to date. 
    ...
    Each process can nowadays have its own individual view of what is mounted,
    and there are as a consequence now individual mounts files for each process in the procfs,
    each process's own table being accessible to it via the self symbolic link as self/mounts,
    and /proc/mounts is also now a compatibility mechanism.

yay -Qo /etc/mtab
    -> filesystem

l /etc/mtab
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     /etc/mtab -> ../proc/self/mounts

sudo rm /etc/mtab
sudo ln -s /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
