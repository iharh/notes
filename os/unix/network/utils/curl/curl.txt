        suppress progress
    --connect-timeout <seconds>
        Maximum  time  in  seconds  that you allow the connection to the
        server to take.  This only limits  the  connection  phase,  once
        curl has connected this option is of no more use.  Since 7.32.0,
        this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout  will
        decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in deci‐
        mal precision. See also the -m, --max-time option.
    -m, --max-time <seconds>
        Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow the whole operation to
        take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hang‐
        ing  for  hours due to slow networks or links going down.  Since
        7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual time‐
        out will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases
        in decimal precision.  See also the --connect-timeout option.
    --keepalive-time
        in seconds
    -T, --upload-file <file>
