	Send SIGTSTP to background job <num>
bg
	Restart a stopped job (and put it to the background) -//- kill -CONT
fg %num
	bring the job to foreground.
	Note: %num also works (without fg) or even %<name_of_cmd>.

	Tell the shell to ignore the job completely (start with &! at the end).


C-z
	SIGTSTP - stop process (can restart later by fg)
C-c
	SIGINT  - terminate/interrupt process
C-\
	IGQUIT  - terminate and make "core dump"


zsh options:

auto_resume
	Allow to resume the job just by typing its name without starting %.
nohup
	Running jobs will not be killed on exit (Stopped jobs are killed by OS anyway).
check_jobs (on by default)
	Warn about stopped and background jobs on exit.
bg_nice (on by default)
	Use the lowest priority for background jobs (see nice command for controlling priority).
