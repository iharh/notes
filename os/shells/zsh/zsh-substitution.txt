`cmd`, $(cmd)
	command substitution... ($-form is preferable since supports inclusions).

Process Substitution:

paste <(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd) <(cut -d: -f5 /etc/passwd)
	We use <(...) to combine output of multiple commands.

make 2> >(grep Error >logfile.txt)
	Just like a pipe but without waiting a command to finish.

emacs =(indent -st < file)
	=(...) is used the same way as <(...), but regular file is created
	to hold the output of commands.


echo =ls
/bin/ls
	The same as echo $(which ls).
	Note: do not confuse =cmd with =(cmd), they have distinct meaning.
