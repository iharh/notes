man zshexpn (expansion and substitution)
	Filename Generation


globbing operators
*
	Zero or more chars
?
	Any single char
[abc]
	Any of the a, b, c
[^a-z] or [!a-z]
	Any char other than a-z
**/pattern
	Match in any subdir (including the current one)
	Note: */**/pattern - excluding the current dir
	Note: ** does not follow sym-links, but *** does
<n1-n2>
	Numeric ranges (either of n can be omitted)


Named ranges for character sets
[[:name:]]

alnum
	A letter or number.
alpha
	A letter.
ascii
	A character in the ASCII set.
blank
	A space or tab. This is a GNU extension and might not always be available.
cntrl
	A control character.
digit
	A decimal digit (number).
graph
	A printable character, but not a space.
lower
	A lowercase character.
print
	A printable character including space.
punct
	A punctuation character, meaning any printable character that is neither alphanumeric nor one of the space characters.
space
	A white-space character, usually space, (horizontal) tab, newline, carriage return plus the less usual vertical tab and form feed.
upper
	An uppercase letter.
xdigit
	A hexadecimal digit; an upper- or lowercase “a” to “f,” or a digit.


Note: We can negate in inner-brackets and so on ([^[:alpha:]])


Glob Qualifiers (at the end of a pattern)
(.)
	matches regular file (not a directory or spec-file)
(/)
	for a directory
(*)
	for an executable regular file
(@)
	for symbolic links
(r),(w),(x)
(R),(W),(X)
(U)
	list a files owned by a user running a shell
Note:
	if we put multiple qualifiers inside paren-s - the effect is combined.
	^ [toggle] can be put not at the beginning to flip the sense - echo *(*r^w).
	we can specify a list of alternatives by commas - echo *(/,*).
	- [toggle] can be put to follow the symliks for the following qualifier - echo *(-*).
	*(-@) - spec case for broken symlinks.
(Lk+100)
(Lm-100)
	length qualifiers
(m+2)
	modified more (older) than 2 days ago
(mM+2)
	-//- M - months, h - hours, w - weeks, m - minutes, s - seconds
(mh-1)
	-//- modified during the last hour
Note: (a...) - for file last access time, (c...) - for changes of file-entry in a directory

(l<num>)
	number of hard-links - *(.l2) - all the regular files with 2 hard-links
(u:root:)
	the owner of a file is a root - /var/*(^u:root:) - list all files in var, not owned by a root
	Note: colons here are for marking the root of. any pair of chars except | is ok - /var/*(^u{root})
(f:u+rx:)
	file-permission
(on)
	Default sorting order as for ls - *(on)
(On)
	Reversed sorting order - *(On)
(oL)
	Sort by file size
(om)
	Sort by modification time. a, c - for access and creation
(ol)
	by linkcount
Note: sorting specifiers can be combined - *(odon) sort first by directory depth then by name...
(...:<colon_modifier>)
	Colon modifiers (see history modifiers from zsh-history) can be used as specifiers at the end, each one
	need to be prefixed by a colon

	





zsh options

globdots
	expand dots in globbing (deal with hidden files)
	Note: echo *l*(D) - lists dots as well (D) is a glob-qualifier
extglob
	@(expr) - match exactly one of the alternatives in expr (|-separated)
	?(expr) - 0 or 1 of -//-
	*(expr) - 0..    of -//-
	+(expr) - 1..    of -//-
	!(expr) - anything except the pattern in expr
	Note: you can not use slashes for dir-separators here
extended_glob
	^ - negated match (^*.o)
	~ - pat_to_match~pat_to_not_match
	# - match a char or group zero or more times
	#i - start case-insensitive glogging, #I - stop it, #l, #L - are a bit more complicated form
	
		
numeric_glob_sort
	any ranges of digits (<...>) are sorted numerically
