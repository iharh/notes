        Normally, when the shell encounters a command,
        it forks off a child process to actually execute the command.
        Using the exec builtin, the shell does not fork,
        and the command exec'ed replaces the shell.
        When used in a script, therefore,
        it forces an exit from the script when the exec'ed command terminates.
