    ! 1. Anticlassic position (right-stand vs left-one)
    ! 2. More speedy/short wrist and forearm movement
    ! 3. Use speed of incoming ball
    !    (without pause and full spinning)
    !    (without sufficiend legs using)
    !    both opponents use active contr-game from backhand
    ! 3. Right backhand playing strategy in order to prepare own attack
    !    who play faster and closer to the table - has more advantage
