    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1DuKpksUrs
    ! slow&spinny - against underspinned ball
    !   hand goes from very low position to very up (above head)
    !   weight transfer with pusing up by right leg
    !   don't forget about recovery
    ! fast&powerful loop - by not-so-much underspin
    !   turn body a little-bit back
    !   swith arm forward (and forcing body forward)
    !   close bat angle
    !   rotate body and move forward
