    ! tactical aspects
    ! bat should be above the table till last moment
    ! moving on by lags - gradually, not super-fast
    ! you should not target to win by this kind of topspin, you should traing good stabily

    ! need to predict ball reflection in the case of bottom-sidespin serve
    ! for the topspin serve - need to make a short-touch without accelerating it

    ! wrist - parallel to table-line (bended back),
    ! more thin contact, kick more up with more-open angle
    ! by side-top spin - accelerate ball by the wrist (mostly by top-part of the ball)
    ! left leg makes short forward-diagonal step after right one
