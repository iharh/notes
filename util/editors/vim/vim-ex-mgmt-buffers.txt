Buffer Management:

:h buffers
  help on windows and buffers


:ls/files/buffers[!]
	List buffers (all open documents) - assigns a unique integer id-number to each buffer
	! - for showing hidden buffers (help, quickfix, l...)
:<N>b
:b-
	<N>
		Go to buffer by the mentioned id-number
	name
		Switch to buffer by name
	n,p
		Switch to the next/previous buffer
	(r,f),l
		Switch to the first/last buffer
	d[elete][!]
		Buffer delete - unload and delete from buffer list(close file)
	w[ipeout][!]
		Buffer wipe-out (delete all info about the buffer)
	a[ll]
		Open all buffers in the separate windows (:sba[ll] - in new windows).
        unh[ide]
		Rearrange the screen to open one window for each loaded buffer (:sun[hide] - in new windows).
	ad[d] <file>
		Add a file to the buffer list without loading it.
	un[load][!]
		Unload buffer from memory (! - without saving).

C-^
	Edit the alternate file (equivalent to ":e #").
	Mostly the alternate file is the previously edited file.
	This is a quick way to toggle between two files.
	
:bufdo /searchstr/
	Search in all open files


Buffer settings:

'hidden' 'hid'
	When on/off a buffer is unloaded when it is abandoned.
'switchbuf' 'swb'
	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
