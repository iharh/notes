Windows:

C-x 0
	Delete the selected window (delete-window). The last character in this key sequence is a zero.
C-x 1
	(delete-other-windows) is more powerful in a different way; it deletes all the windows except
	the selected one (and the minibuffer); the selected window expands to use the whole frame except for the echo area. 
C-x o
	Select another window (other-window). That is o, not zero.
S-"->"
	Focus in direction

C-x 2
	Split vertically (split-window-vertically)
C-x 3
	Split horizontally (split-window-horizontally)
C-x 4 <cmd>
	Execute command in another window
	C-x 4 f - open file in another window (C-x C-f)
	C-x 4 b - open buffer in another window

C-x M-f
	Open file in another window

C-M-v
	To scroll the other window. This is useful to reference one window while editing in the other.

C-x 4 0
	Delete the selected window and kill the buffer that was showing in it (kill-buffer-and-window).



If you add a buffer name to the list same-window-buffer-names, the effect is that such commands display that
particular buffer by switching to it in the selected window. For example, if you add the element "*grep*" to the list,
the grep command will display its output buffer in the selected window. 

*Completions*


Frames:
C-z
	Minimize (or “iconify) the selected Emacs frame (suspend-frame).
	On a text terminal, suspend Emacs; on a graphical display, “minimize” the selected frame (suspend-emacs). 
C-x 5 0
	Delete the selected frame (delete-frame). This is not allowed if there is only one frame. 
C-x 5 o
	Select another frame, raise it, and warp the mouse to it. If you repeat this command, it cycles through
	all the frames on your terminal.
C-x 5 1
	Delete all frames except the selected one.
