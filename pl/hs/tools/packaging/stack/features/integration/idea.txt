I have a pretty good dev setup using stack and IntelliJ (either the free community edition or the ultimate edition)
and the Haskell plugin (there are four - choose the one with the most installs that is from Jetbrains).

Open a project that uses stack, create an execution target.

Under the "Before launch:" area, add two external tools:

1. tool settings: program: stack parameters: build

2. tool settings: program: stack parameters: exec <project name>

where <project name> is the name defined in the first line of your <project name>.cabal file.

If the build breaks, the exec target is not run and the compiler errors are shown.

I have mostly been using Emacs for Haskell development but this setup is also nice to use.?
