class Monad m => MonadPlus m where
  mzero :: m a
  mplus :: m a -> m a -> m a


Note: MonadPlus for Monad is similar to Alternative for Applicative (adding a monoid structure).


instance MonadPlus [] where
  mzero = []
  mplus = (++)


guard :: (MonadPlus m) => Bool -> m ()
guard True  = return ()
guard False = mzero
