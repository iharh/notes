Monads are just Monoids

    A Monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?

The real sentence was:

    All told, a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X,
      with product (x) replaced by composition of endofunctors and
      unit set by the identity endofunctor.

(M, \mu, \eta), where
  - M is endofunctor (A -> M a)
  - \mu  : M x M -> M  is a natural transformation (join, \mu : M (M a) -> M a)
  - \eta : I -> M      is a natural transformation (I is identity functor, \eta : a -> M a)
