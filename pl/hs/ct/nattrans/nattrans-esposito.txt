Natural Transformation Examples (1/4)

data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

toList :: [a] -> List a
toList [] = Nil
toList (x:xs) = Cons x (toList xs)

toList is a natural transformation. It is also a morphism from [] to List in the Category of Hask endofunctors.


Natural Transformation Examples (2/4)

data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

toHList :: List a -> [a]
toHList Nil = []
toHList (Cons x xs) = x:toHList xs

toHList is a natural transformation. It is also a morphism from List to [] in the Category of Hask endofunctors.


Natural Transformation Examples (3/4)

toMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
toMaybe [] = Nothing
toMaybe (x:xs) = Just x

toMaybe is a natural transformation. It is also a morphism from [] to Maybe in the Category of Hask endofunctors.


Natural Transformation Examples (4/4)

mToList :: Maybe a -> [a]
mToList Nothing = []
mToList Just x  = [x]

toMaybe is a natural transformation. It is also a morphism from [] to Maybe in the Category of Hask endofunctors
