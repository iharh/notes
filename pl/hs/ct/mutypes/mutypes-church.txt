Leaf Tree sample:

data Tree a = Empty | Leaf a | Fork (Tree a) (Tree a)

data Tree_ a b = Empty_ | Leaf_ a | Fork_ b b

data Tree+ a = exist s. Tree+ (s -> Tree_ a s) s  -- as a pair with stepper and initial seed


toCoCh :: Tree a -> Tree+ a
toCoCh t = Tree+ out t
  where
    out Empty      = Empty_
    out (Leaf a)   = Leaf_ a
    out (Fork l r) = Fork_ l r

fromCoCh :: Tree+ a -> Tree a
fromCoCh (Tree+ h s) = unfold h s
  where
    unfold h s = case h s of
      Empty_      -> Empty
      Leaf_ a     -> Leaf a
      Fork_ sl sr -> Fork (unfold h sl) (unfold h sr)
