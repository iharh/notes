Jones - Secrets of the GHC Inliner

Inlining:
-- | Function composition.
{-# INLINE (.) #-}
-- Make sure it has TWO args only on the left, so that it inlines
-- when applied to two functions, even if there is no final argument
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(.) f g = \x -> f (g x)

-- The following will not be inlined for 2 args available, since it has 3:
(.) f g x = f (g x)

INLINABLE pragma - for recommendation to inline, not a force

-funfolding-use-threshold=16

Note: not-exported functions are inlined by default within a module

-ddump-hi - to dump the hi-file (inlined functions should not be there).
