tuple
    a = (1, 2, 3)

indexed from 0 like a[<idx>]
a[idx1:]
a[idx1:idx2]
    semi-open range
a[:idx2]
a[:]
    the copy of a (but in case of tuple - just a tuple itself since a tuple is immutable/const)
a[idx1:idx2:step]
    ... step
if idx is negative, this is an offset from the end of the sequence

we can assign like
    v1, v2, v3 = 1, 2, 3

range/xrange (py 3)

list
    b = [1, 2, 3]

insert
len
reverse
sort
extend
