    you should never mess with the system dependencies, but instead, install PDM in an isolated env.
    Look at the installation guide, we never recommend installing PDM into the global site-packages.

    It turns out the redistributed pip has a special debundling process that adds the wheels path in front of sys.path.
    As a workaround, you can re-install the pip in the venv by:
        ~/.local/share/pdm/venv/bin/pip install -I pip
