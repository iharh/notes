std::for_each (coll.begin(), coll.end(), MyValue()) returns MyValue (Returns a copy of the [internally modified] op)

std::remove_copy, remove_copy_if
std::replace_copy

std::copy_backward

std::transform - for transformation (2 forms - for single range and 2 ranges)

swap, fill, generate,

std::rotate, rotate_copy
std::next_permutation, std::random_shuffle
std::partition, stable_partition

std::sord, std::stable_sord(keep an order of equal elems).
std::partial_sort - sorts only a part of range
std::partial_sort_copy
std::nth_element - sorts according to the n-th element

heap algorithms:
std::make_heap, std::push_heap, std::pop_heap, std::sort_heap (convert a heap into sorted collection)

sorted range algorithms:

std::binary_search - check Whether one element is present (to obtain the position of an element for which
you are searching, use lower_bound(), upper_bound(), or equal_range() )

std::includes - checking Whether Several elements are present

std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound - searching first  /  last possible position
std::equal_range                   - searching first AND last possible position

std::merge - processing the sum of two sorted sets
The destination range contains all elements that are in the first source range plus those that are in the
second source range.

std::set_union
Elements that are in both ranges are in the union range only once. However, duplicates are possible if elements
occur more than once in one of the source ranges. The number of occurrences of equal elements in the destination
range is the maximum of the number of their occurrences in both source ranges

std::set_intersection - Processing the Intersection of Two Sorted Sets

std::set_difference, std::set_symmetric_difference - Processing the Difference of Two Sorted Sets

std::inplace_merge - Merging Consecutive Sorted Ranges
