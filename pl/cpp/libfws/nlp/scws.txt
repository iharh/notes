SCWS (Simple Chinese Word Segmentation) is a frequency dictionary based Chinese word segmentation engine,
it can cut a whole section of the Chinese text into words.

Word is the smallest unit of morpheme in Chinese,
but in Chinese words are not separated by spaces,
so word segmentation is an important step for Chinese language process.

SCWS is written in C without other dependencies and accept GBK and UTF-8 encoding
for both the Simple Chinese (zh_CN) and the Traditional Chinese (such as zh_TW).
