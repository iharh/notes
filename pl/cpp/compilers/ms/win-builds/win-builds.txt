Automated install

As a stop-gap measure for the lack of an up-to-date installer, a .bat file has been written. Simply download the win-builds binaries, extract them and run ‘win-install.bat’. It will install files in ‘C:\win-builds-32’ and ‘C:\win-builds-64’; if you want to change the path, simply edit the .bat file in any text editor.
Note

That if you want to update packages later on, you will need the content of the archive.

The toolchain will then be setup and can be used standalone or from an IDE. The only settings needed is to set the PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment variable to chose between the 32 bits and 64 bits toolchain:

    for 32 bits:
        prepend C:\win-builds-32\bin to PATH
        set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR to C:\win-builds-32\lib\pkgconfig 

    for 64 bits:
	call D:\dev\bin\cmd\vars-path-prepend.bat D:\win-builds-64\bin
	set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=D:\win-builds-64\lib64\pkgconfig

    start %ComSpec% %* 

Note

The 64 bits toolchain requires a 64 bits host to run.
Manual steps

The code below is a summary of what is done at installation on Windows. If you want all the details, you should look at the source of win-install.bat.

Download and extract the yypkg binaries. Note that if you want to update packages later on, you will need the content of the archive. Then, start a command prompt (cmd.exe), enter the directory where you’ve extracted the files and run:

set YYPREFIX=C:/win-builds-32
yypkg -init
yypkg -config -setpreds host="i686-w64-mingw32"
yypkg -config -setpreds target="i686-w64-mingw32"
sherpa -set-mirror http://win-builds.org/1.3.0/packages/windows_32
sherpa -install all


http://win-builds.org/stable/msys-cygwin.html

\msys\1.0\opt\windows_64\var\cache\packages\


Download the yypkg binaries and extract them into the home directory of MSYS/Cygwin:
  for MSYS: C:/win_builds/msys/1.0/home/[your_account_name]
  for Cygwin: C:/Cygwin/home/[your_account_name] 

Note

If you want to update packages later on, you will need the content of the archive.

    In the MSYS/Cygwin prompt, enter the directory where you’ve extracted the yypkg binaries (typically win-builds-bundle) and run one of:

    ./msys-cygwin-install.sh x86_64

    Check gcc is running well:

    gcc --version

    Set a default toolchain (optional):

    echo '. win-builds-switch.sh 64' >> ~/.profile
    echo '. win-builds-switch.sh 32' >> ~/.profile

3. Change toolchain on-the-fly

The win-builds-switch.sh script takes care of everything; run it in your shell like:

# To switch to the x86_64 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 64
# To switch to the i686 toolchain
. win-builds-switch.sh 32
