What about when we do want to use v0.3.9?
Cargo has another command, update, which says ‘ignore the lock, figure out all the latest versions that fit what we’ve specified.
If that works, write those versions out to the lock file’.

But, by default, Cargo will only look for versions larger than 0.3.0 and smaller than 0.4.0.
If we want to move to 0.4.x, we’d have to update the Cargo.toml directly.
When we do, the next time we cargo build, Cargo will update the index and re-evaluate our rand requirements.
