Send/Sync traits:

Major exceptions include:
    raw pointers are neither Send nor Sync (because they have no safety guards).
    UnsafeCell isn't Sync (and therefore Cell and RefCell aren't).
    Rc isn't Send or Sync (because the refcount is shared and unsynchronized).
...
In the incredibly rare case that a type is inappropriately automatically derived to be Send or Sync, then one can also unimplement Send and Sync:

#![feature(optin_builtin_traits)]

// I have some magic semantics for some synchronization primitive!
struct SpecialThreadToken(u8);

impl !Send for SpecialThreadToken {}
impl !Sync for SpecialThreadToken {}
