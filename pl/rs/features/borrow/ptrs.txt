Deref-trait:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html
Similar to how we use the Deref trait to override * on &Ts, there is also a DerefMut trait for overriding * on &mut T

Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

From &T to &U
    when T: Deref<Target=U>.
From &mut T to &mut U
    when T: DerefMut<Target=U>.
From &mut T to &U
    when T: Deref<Target=U>.

The reason that the Deref trait is important to the smart pointer pattern is that smart pointers can then be treated like regular references and used in places that expect regular references. We don't have to redefine methods and functions to take smart pointers explicitly, for example

Drop-trait:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html

    std::mem::drop - to drop some object earlier
pub mod std {
    pub mod mem {
        pub fn drop<T>(x: T) { } // just takes an ownership
    }
}


Box<T>
    for allocating vals on the heap
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/
Rc<T>
    refcounted type, so data can have multiple owners
    ! single-thread-only ! we can only read immutable refs of T
RefCell<T>
    https://rust-lang.github.io/book/second-edition/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html
    isn't a smart-ptr itself, but manages access to the smart pointers Ref
    like a Box<T>, but follows "interior mutability" pattern
        fn borrow<'a>(&'a self) -> Ref<'a, T>
            &r.borrow()
        fn borrow_mut<'a>(&'a self) -> RefMut<'a, T>
            &mut r.borrow_mut()
            // these 2 types impl Deref-trait, Drop trait,
            // track the borrow dynamically
    If we don't check borrow rules at runtime, we will end up with:
        panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError
Cell<T>
    is similar to RefCell<T>, but insetead of giving references to the inner value, the value is copied in and out of the Cell<T>.
    Note: Mutex<T> offers interior mutability that is safe to use across threads
Weak<T>
    For situation which have cycles, but only one direction expresses ownership.
    upgrade/downgrade
MutexGuard<T>
    for mutexes
Arc<T>
    Atomic reference counting (just like Rc)
A type is
    Send, if it is safe to move to another thread
    Sync, if it is safe to share between multiple threads
        That is, if T is Sync, &T is Send
    (safe here means it is impossible to cause data races)

2 major classes of interior mutability:
    Cells, only work in a single-threaded context)
    Locks, work in a multi-threaded context

Rc<T> just uses a cell (not thread-safe)
Arc<T> uses an atomic (thread-safe)
