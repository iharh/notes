In JDK8 you have to change permissions on hsperfdata_username in whatever %TMP% is for it to work.
I received an error message when visual VM first started and I went to the link which described the problem with access permissions
and when I checked the permissions on the file using “properties” the permissions were set to read-only on the first page and no access permissions were granted on the following pages.

I changed the permissions to grant everything to everybody on my home computer and that worked.
