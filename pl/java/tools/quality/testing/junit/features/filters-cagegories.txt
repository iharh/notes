Filter and Categories:

When running JUnit from the command line, a command-line parameter can be supplied using --filter,
which supplies a filter that will restrict which tests and subtests from the rest of the command will be run.

For example, this will run only the tests in ExampleTestSuite that are in categories Cat1 or Cat2:

java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore --filter=org.junit.experimental.categories.IncludeCategories=pkg.of.Cat1,pkg.of.Cat2 com.example.ExampleTestSuite

In general, the argument to --filter should be ClassName=param,
where ClassName names an implementation of FilterFactory,
whose createFilter method will be called with an instance of FilterFactoryParams that contains "param",
in order to return the filter to be applied.
