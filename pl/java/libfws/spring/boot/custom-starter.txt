JavaJam - Tolkachev, Gorelikov - Why write a custom starter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVlhnO4UzE

A full Spring Boot starter for a library may contain the following components:
* The autoconfigure module that contains the auto-configuration code.
* The starter module that provides a dependency to the autoconfigure module as well
  as the library and any additional dependencies that are typically useful.
  In a nutchell, addding the starter should be enought to start using the library.
