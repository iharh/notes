... anything, related to RetryTemplate, dropping failed msg, DLQ, ... only applies to message handlers (imperative functions)
    not to the reactive stream processors
Reactive API provides a very rich library of its own operators and mechanisms to assist you with error handling
specific to variety of reactive uses cases which are far more complex then simple Message handler cases,
So use them, such as public final Flux<T> retryWhen(Retry retrySpec); that you can find in reactor.core.publisher.Flux.
