    Service are created by using the Javaâ€™s java.util.ServiceLoader service-provider loading facility.
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html

    It is used to locate all org.ehcache.spi.service.ServiceFactory implementations on the classpath.
    These are in turn used to create Service instances.
    Each CacheManager uses its own org.ehcache.spi.ServiceLocator facility to locate Service instances,
    which it then in turn life cycles.
