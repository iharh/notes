authorization code
    client redirects user to login page
    ! the user is directly interacts with auth-server
    response_type=code 
    client_id=<app-id>
    redirect_uri=...
    scope=<granted-authorities>
    state=CSRF-token

    the client redirects the user to auth-server
    after successful auth, auth-server provides a code to client and state value
    and the client can use this code later in order to obtain a token (access_token)

implicit grant type (not recommended)
    to obtain a token without using a code
password
    grant_type=password
    scope
    used only when client and auth-server are maintained by the same org
client credentials
    grant_type=client_credentials
    client_id
    client_code
    scope

    simplest grant type,
    we can use it when no user is involved
    no refresh token
refresh token
    grant_type=refresh_token
