To bypass the file system type check, set the -XX:+PerfBypassFileSystemCheck option on the java command line for both the
applications you want to monitor and for the jvmstat tools. Setting this option for target applications is application
specific. For the jvmstat tools, the following environment variable can be set before running any of the commands:
set VMARGS=-XX:+PerfBypassFileSystemCheck

_JAVA_LAUNCHER_DEBUG


javac options:
javac -Xpring classname

memory
-XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize=160m
    by default is 1GB.
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage"
    for java 10, but we still need to know this percentage
 -XX:UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap
    It'll tell JVM to calculate how much memory it could use for heap based on memory available to Docker container,
    so you don't need to guess heap size.
