PostCSS is a JavaScript tool which will read your CSS with special additional syntax and will process it and return normal CSS code.
The tool itself is a Node.js module that parses CSS into an AST; passes that AST through any number of “plugin” functions;
    and then converts that AST back into a string, which you can output to a file. 

Whatever your definitions of “postprocessor” and “preprocessor”, there will be PostCSS plugins that fall into both camps.
According to most definitions, Autoprefixer is the iconic “postprocessor”;
    but there’s also stuff like postcss-each, which is very “preprocessor”-y.
