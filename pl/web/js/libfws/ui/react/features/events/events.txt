    () => ... handlers are not equal to each other
https://css-tricks.com/working-with-events-in-react/

react wraps browser native events to:
SyntheticEvent
    .stopPropagation()
    .preventDefault()
    .nativeEvent property

React does not actually attach event handlers to the DOM nodes themselves.
It uses general event-listener and dispatches events itself to appropriate event handlers.
