I have never written a tutorial but I will try to give a summary.
Assuming basic familiarity with both D3 and Snap: The following is possible.

d3.select('.somethingsvg').data(data).each(function(d) { Snap(this).whatever; });

d3 selects the nodes and takes the data.
(You may have to use .enter and/or .append if you are creating more nodes or have more data than current nodes.)
The .each function runs for each selected node and inside that anon fn
you can use Snap(this) to reference the node for which the iteration of each is running and perform some kind of action.

In my project, I am using Snap to implement some hover event listeners.
I could use jQuery to implement the hover events because it integrates equally well,
however, since it is an svg I am using Snap since I am drawing more svg on hover.
