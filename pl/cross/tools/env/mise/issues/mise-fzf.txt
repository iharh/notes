https://github.com/kompiro/asdf-fzf/issues/2
    The latest release of fzf (v0.54.0) documents a change in the tagging scheme to include the "v" prefix. 
    I've updated my local version of this plugin to use that new naming scheme for the download_url since I generally stay on the latest releases. 
    I'm not sure how to conditionally apply this as a PR to this project without breaking backwards compat.
