    SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=

    From any Sourcegraph page, click on your avatar at the top right of the page.
    Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
    Select "Access tokens" from the sidebar menu.
    Click "Generate new token".
    Enter a description, such as "src".

    NOTE: The "user:all scope" that is selected by default is sufficient for all normal src usage, and most uses of the GraphQL API.
    If youâ€™re an admin, you should only enable site-admin:sudo if you intend to impersonate other users.

    Click "Generate token".

    Sourcegraph will now display your access token.
    You must copy it from this screen:
        once this page is closed, you cannot access the token again,
        and can only revoke it and issue a new one.
