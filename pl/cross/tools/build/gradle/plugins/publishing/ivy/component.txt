    Any single version of a module.

    For external libraries, the term component refers to one published version of the library.

    In a build, components are defined by plugins (e.g. the Java Library plugin) and provide a simple way to define a publication for publishing.
    They comprise artifacts as well as the appropriate metadata that describes a component’s variants in detail.
    For example, the java component in its default setup consists of a JAR — produced by the jar task —
    and the dependency information of the Java api and runtime variants.
    It may also define additional variants, for example sources and Javadoc, with the corresponding artifacts.
