I started to develop the debugger when I saw a requirement of a useful debugger.
You may look to this demonstration:

If you want to perform remote debugging, you will have two choices:

    Running GDBFrontend on your server and use it from remote.

    Running GDBFrontend on local machine and connect to gdbserver.

GDBFrontend provides you a full-featured GDB debugging chance from remote. It is good when you think about gdbserver's limitations.

Also you may want to look these options:

--listen=IP, -l IP: Specifies listen address for HTTP and WS servers.
--credentials=USER:PASS, -c USER:PASS: Specifies username and password for accessing to debugger (Browser asks it for two times).)
