=== Important Notes: ===
Data Packaging: static
 This means: ICU data will be stored in a static library.
 To locate data: ICU will use the linked data library. If linked with the stub library located in stubdata/, the application can use udata_setCommonData() or set a data path to override.
Building ICU: Use a GNU make such as make to build ICU.
checking the version of "make"... 4.3 (we wanted at least 3.80)
ok
C++ apps may want to build with CXXFLAGS =  -std=c++11
