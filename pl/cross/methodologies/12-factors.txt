The 12 factors developers should think about when building native cloud apps are:

Code base:              use one codebase, even when building cross-platform apps.
Dependencies:           declare and isolate all dependencies.
Configuration:          design the app to read its config from the environment.
Backing Services:       treat back-end services as attached resources to be accessed with a URL or other locator stored in config.
Build, Release, Run:    strictly separate build and run stages.
Processes:              execute the app as one or more stateless processes, and store persistent data in a stateful backing service.
Port binding:           use port binding to export services.
Concurrency:            scale apps out horizontally, not vertically.
Disposability:          use fast startups and shutdowns to maximize resilience.
Parity:                 make sure that development, staging, and production environments are as similar as possible.
Logs:                   treat logs as event streams.
Admin processes:        keep admin tasks in source control and packaged with the application.
