    Core: Enable doc values by default, when appropriate
    
    Doc values significantly reduced heap usage, which results in faster
    GCs. This change makes the default for doc values dynamic: any
    field that is indexed but not analyzed now has doc values. This only
    affects fields on indexes created with 2.0+.
