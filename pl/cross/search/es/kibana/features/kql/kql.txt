    @timestamp:2015-09-22 (shows just that day's data)
    @timestamp:2015-09-22T23 (shows just that hour's data)
    But an unquoted date/time string containing : doesn't work. But quoted it does;
    @timestamp:"2015-09-22T23:50:13.253" returns just the one doc with that timestamp.
    @timestamp:"2015-09-22T23:50" also works. Returns docs in that hour:minute.
