You're not waiting until the bulk request finishes. If you call execute() without actionGet(), you end up running asynchronously.
Which means you will start changing aliases and deleting indexes before the new index is completely built.

client.admin().indices().aliases(new IndicesAliasesRequest().removeAlias(currentIndexName, "my_index").addAlias("my_index", newIndexName)).get();

This should be ended with execute().actionGet() and not get(). that is probably why your alias is not getting set

I can only do .actionGet() , .execute() is no method in IndicesAdminClient.java .
Nevertheless, I would somehow like to do that re-aliasing asynchronously but only after the re-indexing is done completely without errors.
But I haven't found a way to do that yet.

action.admin.indices.alias.get.GetAliasRequest


index:

action.support.IndicesOption
  allowAliasesToMultipleIndices ?

action.IndicesRequest
  .Replaceable

action.admin.indices.delete.DeleteIndexRequest
  extends MasterNodeOperationRequest<DeleteIndexRequest> implements IndicesRequest.Replaceable
